LabQAR: A Manually Curated Dataset for Question Answering on Laboratory Test Reference Ranges and Interpretation

Laboratory tests are crucial for diagnosing and managing health conditions, offering essential reference ranges for result interpretation. The diversity of lab tests, influenced by variables like the specimen type (e.g., blood, urine), gender, age-specific, and other influencing factors like pregnancy, makes automated interpretation challenging. Automated clinical decision support systems attempting to interpret these values must account for such nuances to avoid misdiagnoses or incorrect clinical decisions. In this regard, we present LabQAR (Laboratory Question Answering with Reference Ranges), a manually curated dataset containing multiple-choice questions about 550 lab tests with comprehensive reference ranges sourced from trusted medical resources with annotations on reference ranges, specimen types, and other factors impacting interpretation. We also assess the performance of several large language models (LLMs), including LLaMA 3.1, GatorTronGPT, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o, in predicting reference ranges and classifying results as normal, low, or high. The findings indicate that GPT-4o outperforms other models, showcasing the potential of LLMs in clinical decision support.
